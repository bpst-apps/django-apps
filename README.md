# Django Applications

# Django Project
Django is a free and open-source web framework written in Python. It is designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. Django follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

To get started with a Django project, you'll need to install Django and set up a new project. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install Django:
```
pip install Django
```
2. Create a new Django project:
```
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This will create a new directory called "myproject" with the basic files and directories needed for a Django project.

3. Change into the project directory:
```
cd myproject
```

4. Run the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
This will start the development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You can visit this URL in your web browser to view your Django project.
