# Django + MySQL
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that allows you to interact with a database using Python. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is widely used in web applications.

You can use Django with MySQL as the database backend by installing the mysqlclient package and configuring the database settings in your Django project. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
# Install mysqlclient
pip install mysqlclient

# In your Django settings.py file, add the following settings:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

Then, run the following command to create the necessary tables in the database:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

You can then use Django's ORM to query the MySQL database in your application.
